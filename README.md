# Building a Neural Network Regression model on TensorFlow

As part of Zero To Mastery's [Tensorflow Certificate Course](https://dev.mrdbourke.com/tensorflow-deep-learning/01_neural_network_regression_in_tensorflow/#a-larger-example) we'll try to predict the cost of medical insurance for individuals based on a number of different parameters such as: `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoking_status` and `residential_region`.

To do, we'll leverage the pubically available [Medical Cost dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) available from Kaggle and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv).
